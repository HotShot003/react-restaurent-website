This project is a part of my learning journey with React, where I will be building a restaurant website based on a Figma design. 
The project will be updated daily until completion.

The goal of this project is to create a fully functional and visually appealing website for a restaurant, showcasing various sections such as the menu, about us, contact information, and more.
